## How it works

Coming soon!

todo: I have stalled on this as I moved into other more pressing projects. When I come back to work on this, start with:
1. figuring out why GET requests are 404ing out. You may not be handling routes according to Svelte pattern, or you may have inadvertently confused different variable values as you handle them in and out of your database.
2. todo: For README: explain why
3. todo: For README: add what a post looks like
